# _Use at your own risk!_

### Do not completely trust this code! Check the source! Make sure to have at least one hard copy of passwords you need the most (for example: email)

Stupidly simple password generator tool based on keywords: just enter bunch of words in the fields and press **Submit**. No passwords are stored. _Ordering matters!!!_ Make sure to have at least two words (fields) and always enter them in the correct order (for example: _[ MyMasterPass, MySecondPass ]_ will produce different result from _[ MySecondPass, MyMasterPass ]_.

I am not a security expert. I just made this to be able to generate strong passwords with little effort. Use as you please. I figured out that at least 3 fields are needed in order to have good security: a master password, a site name, and some value you could easily change when you need to change a leaked password (for example: date). I am not sure whether leaked passwords could be reverse-engineered to extract the exact words, but it seems unlikely. Still - no guarantees!
